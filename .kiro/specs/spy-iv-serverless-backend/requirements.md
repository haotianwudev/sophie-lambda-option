# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a serverless backend using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to fetch SPY option chain data, calculate implied volatility (IV) smile, and retrieve the current VIX value. The backend provides a single, cost-effective, and scalable HTTP endpoint that can be consumed by a Next.js frontend or other client applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a single HTTP endpoint to fetch option data with calculated implied volatility for any ticker, so that I can display comprehensive options analytics without implementing complex financial calculations on the client side.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to the `/options-analytics` endpoint with a ticker parameter THEN the system SHALL return option chain data with calculated implied volatility for both calls and puts
2. WHEN no ticker parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL default to SPY as the ticker
3. WHEN the endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL include the current stock price for the specified ticker in the response
4. WHEN the endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL always include the current VIX value in the response regardless of ticker
5. WHEN the endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return option chains for all available expiration dates
6. WHEN the endpoint processes options data THEN the system SHALL filter out options where implied volatility cannot be calculated
7. WHEN the endpoint returns data THEN the system SHALL include the as-of timestamp for both option data and VIX data
8. WHEN the endpoint returns data THEN the system SHALL format the response as valid JSON with proper structure for frontend consumption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to be deployed using Infrastructure as Code, so that the deployment is repeatable, version-controlled, and easily maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the backend THEN the system SHALL use Serverless Framework for infrastructure definition
2. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL create an AWS Lambda function with appropriate configuration
3. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL create an API Gateway endpoint that triggers the Lambda function
4. WHEN the Lambda function is configured THEN the system SHALL have appropriate timeout settings to handle financial data API calls
5. WHEN the Lambda function is configured THEN the system SHALL have sufficient memory allocation for pandas/numpy operations
6. WHEN the API Gateway is configured THEN the system SHALL enable CORS for cross-origin requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want the API to handle errors gracefully, so that I can provide meaningful feedback to users when data is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SPY price cannot be fetched THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status code with an error message
2. WHEN the VIX value cannot be fetched THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status code with an error message
3. WHEN no option expiration dates are found THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status code with an error message
4. WHEN any unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status code with the error details
5. WHEN an error response is returned THEN the system SHALL include proper CORS headers
6. WHEN the system is functioning normally THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with the complete data payload

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want accurate implied volatility calculations for any ticker's options, so that I can analyze the volatility smile and make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating implied volatility THEN the system SHALL use the Black-Scholes model via py_vollib library
2. WHEN calculating implied volatility THEN the system SHALL use the current stock price of the specified ticker as the underlying price
3. WHEN calculating implied volatility THEN the system SHALL calculate time to expiration in years from the current date
4. WHEN calculating implied volatility THEN the system SHALL use a reasonable risk-free rate (e.g., 1%)
5. WHEN calculating implied volatility THEN the system SHALL handle both call and put options with appropriate option type flags
6. WHEN implied volatility cannot be calculated for an option THEN the system SHALL exclude that option from the response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want delta calculations for options, so that I can understand the price sensitivity of options to the underlying stock movement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating option Greeks THEN the system SHALL calculate delta for both calls and puts using the Black-Scholes model
2. WHEN delta calculations fail for an option THEN the system SHALL still include the option in the response with null values for the failed calculation
3. WHEN the response includes delta THEN the system SHALL format it as a numerical value with appropriate precision

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious developer, I want the backend to be optimized for serverless deployment, so that I only pay for actual usage and the system scales automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is idle THEN the system SHALL incur no compute costs
2. WHEN multiple requests are made simultaneously THEN the system SHALL automatically scale to handle the load
3. WHEN the Lambda function executes THEN the system SHALL complete within the configured timeout period
4. WHEN Python dependencies are packaged THEN the system SHALL use native packaging without Docker for simplicity
5. WHEN the function is deployed THEN the system SHALL have minimal cold start time through appropriate memory allocation
6. WHEN the API is accessed THEN the system SHALL respond efficiently without unnecessary resource consumption
